# Making Hilbert Curve from image
* In `curve.py` contained Python code to convert RGB or grayscale image to **Hilbert Space-Filling Curve** (also works with PNG)
* In `example.ipynb` example of usage with visualization
* #### ‚≠êStar the repo, if you like it!‚≠ê
## Prerequisites:
```bash
pip install numpy numpy-hilbert-curve
```
For running `example.ipynb`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Visualization
* This is original images(left), and reshaped Hilbert Curve images(right)
* because Hilbert Curve is 1-d(its length), line was reshaped to square on this image
